1. Start by reading Articles/Typing-in-JavaScript.md to get a general overview. 
   * JavaScripts built-in typing support is broken, but how do you fix it? <br><br>

   * Read type-quickly/ReadMe.md to see how to use the type-quickly package.
   * Read type-robustly/ReadMe.md to see how to use the type-robustly package. <br><br>
3. More later.
